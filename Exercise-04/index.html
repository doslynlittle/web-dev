<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>You can tell your old man
  <p>You'll do some largemouth fishing another time</p>
<p>You just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line</p>
<p>You can always put a rain check in his hand</p>
<p>'Til you can't</p>
<p>You can keep putting off forever with that girl who's heart you hold</p>
<p>Swearing that you'll ask some day further down the road</p>
<p>You can always put a diamond on her hand</p>
<p>'Til you can't</p>
<p>If you got a chance, take it, take it while you got a chance</p>
<p>If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back</p>
<p>If you're gonna love somebody</p>
<p>Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can</p>
<p>'Til you can't</p>
<p>There's a box of greasy parts sitting in the trunk of that '65</p>
<p>Still waiting on you and your granddad to bring it back to life</p>
<p>You can always get around to fixing up that Pontiac</p>
<p>'Til you can't</p>
<p>If you got a chance, take it, take it while you got a chance</p>
<p>If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back</p>
<p>If you're gonna love somebody</p>
<p>Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can</p>
<p>'Til you can't</p>
<p>So take that phone call from your momma and just talk away</p>
<p>'Cause you'll never know how bad you wanna 'til you can't someday</p>
<p>Don't wait on tomorrow 'cause tomorrow may not show</p>
<p>Say your sorries, your I-love-yous, 'cause man you never know</p>
<p>If you got a chance, take it, take it while you got a chance</p>
<p>If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back</p>
<p>If you're gonna love somebody</p>
<p>Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can</p>
<p>'Til you can't</p>
<p>Yeah, if you got a chance, take it (take it), take it while you got a chance</p>
<p>If you got a dream, chase it, 'cause a dream won't chase you back</p>
<p>If you're gonna love somebody</p>
<p>Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can</p>
<p>Until you can't</p>
<p>'Til you can't</p>
<p>Yeah, take it</p>
