       <h1>Why I Chose Crepes</h1>
       </div>
     <p> I chose to show how to make crepes because it was a big recipe in my family home. I grew up having a crepe breakfast every sunday after church. My dad would always have me help him crack the eggs and spread the batter. We actually have our own recipe we use but it is more complex. I stuck with a simple recipe for this project. Having crepes is also important to me because I can cary on the tradition with my kids. I recenlty lost my dad so i hold our special moments together making crepes close in my heart. I know it may be hard to believe being so attached to a simple recipe, but I will never forget it or the memories behind making crepes.  </p>
